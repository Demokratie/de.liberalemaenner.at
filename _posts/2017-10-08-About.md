Liberale MÃ¤nner (Liberal Men Austria) are a group of men promoting equal rights for men.
We plan forming an association on International Men's Day 2017
which is intended to be a lobbying platform connected to one or more political parties.

# Why "Liberal Men"?

1. Based in [western liberal tradition](liberal.html)
2. Promoting [Men's Rights](men.html)
