Liberale MÃ¤nner (Liberal Men Austria) is an Austrian association promoting equal rights for men.
Our first meeting was on International Men's Day 2017
for the screening of The Red Pill movie and we are planning to lobby for mens rights across 
the political spectrum in Austria, Europe and the Western world.

## Why "Liberal Men"?

1. Based in [Western Liberal Tradition](liberal.html)
2. Promoting [Men's Rights](men.html)
